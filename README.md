This is a complete re-write of IPSetter (VB.NET) 
Now I will  use this to try and further my understanding of C# language instead

version 0.0.1.0 is completly re-written from scratch to be identical to IpSetter (VB.NET version) going forward this is the only repository that will be worked on.

only differences is how the setting of the IP addressed and DHCP are handled. Instead of invoding a CMD process it is now done in code.
